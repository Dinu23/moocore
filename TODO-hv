Version 2.0rc2 has some improvements from Andreia to the recursive hypervolume that are still not part of moocore: https://lopez-ibanez.eu/hypervolume#download

a) Issue error if number is infinite or NaN
   x = strtod(str, &endp);
   if(!isnormal(x)) error("x is infinite or NaN");

b) check overflow/underflow: strtod() returns plus or minus HUGE_VAL
   (HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL) is returned (according to the sign of the
   value), and ERANGE is stored in errno.  If the correct value would
   cause underflow, zero is returned and ERANGE is stored in errno.

   errno = 0;
   x = strtod(str, &endp);
   if(errno != 0) { error("Overflow/underflow");

6) Sort array in memory by 3rd (or 2nd) dimension, depending on
   special case used. This may (or may not) improve performance
   significantly for large sets, by speeding up the special case.

7) verify the handling of repeated coordinate values and of dominated
   points, to avoid performing more math operations than actually
   required in these cases.
