The goal of **moocore** is to collect fast implementations of core mathematical functions and algorithms for multi-objective optimization. These functions include:

* Identifying and filtering dominated vectors.
* Quality metrics such as (weighted) hypervolume, epsilon, IGD, etc.
* Computation of the Empirical Attainment Function. The empirical attainment
  function (EAF) describes the probabilistic distribution of the outcomes
  obtained by a stochastic algorithm in the objective space.

**Keywords**: empirical attainment function, summary attainment surfaces, EAF
differences, multi-objective optimization, bi-objective optimization,
performance measures, performance assessment
