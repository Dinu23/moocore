This webpage documents the ``moocore`` Python package. There is also a ``moocore`` `R package <https://multi-objective.github.io/moocore/r>`_.

The goal of the **moocore** project (https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore/) is to collect fast implementations of core mathematical functions and algorithms for multi-objective optimization and make them available to different programming languages via similar interfaces. These functions include:

* Identifying and filtering dominated vectors.
* Quality metrics such as (weighted) hypervolume, epsilon, IGD, etc.
* Computation of the Empirical Attainment Function. The empirical attainment function (EAF) describes the probabilistic distribution of the outcomes obtained by a stochastic algorithm in the objective space.

Most critical functionality is implemented in C, with the R and Python packages providing convenient interfaces to the C code.
